## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I think we had a solid plan and our meetings were short and effective. I think especially this week, everyone got a solid understanding of what to do with the project since the set-up was quite clear. However, we will see.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We had some issues regarding creating issues on the milestones repository since we wanted to have the code in a completely different repository. GitHub allows to link project boards but not the issues and milestones themselves in a cross platform way. So, we created a repository called Codebase and just started coding there.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We managed to finish the main annotation feature and the only thing that left is to link it to the database. Since it was the main feature, I think the app is halfway there. We did not completely get to the small bits of the landing page, the fancy designs and databases, so our milestone is only 33% complete. But we did not have ambitious goals for this milestone anyways since we were all in exam weeks. 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I would not say that anything is at risk currently, because no one encountered a problem yet. However, I am guessing that adjusting "file permissions" will be a hard task to do and a database challenge in general. However, we did not get to that part yet so we will see.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I think learning how to do file permissions would be great, or just learning how to implement who sees what in a web application and principles such principle of least privileges would be great.
