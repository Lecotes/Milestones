## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I think everyone worked quite well in their own seperate issues this week and on that side it went really well. We also reshaped a lot of planning at the beginning of the week and tried to avoid scope-creep a bit. I think our initial plan turned out to be a bit more ambitious and we navigated it well.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We worked seperately a lot, which meant that we were mainly isolated. This caused our features to be a bit disconnected from time to time. Despite finishing most of the main features, combining them together in the last sprint is going to take a little bit of time I think. Even when combining the login/signup, file upload and annotation features for this week, we had a lot of integration problems. However, it is working out at the end.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

***100%!!!!*** We finished all of our tasks in the plan for this week. The remaining tasks mainly focus on integration between these differently implemented features and polishing the app. For the remaining tasks, there is only 1 "feature-feature," which is the friend groups formation and assigning to entire groups etc.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Maybe some of the more advanced visibility functions such as group assignments to projects might be at risk since those might be a bit ambitious to implement. It might almost be doing a drive 2.0 on that sense, so, we are not sure if we are going to implement it.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Maybe help in learning how to integrate stuff would be lovely. We have many working things seperate from each other as standalone features, but everytime we want to combine them, we find ourselves spending hours in general.
